    Vanilla:         Weapon mods are not added as items. Mods are unlocked and limited as they are in the base game.
    Modpack:         Weapon modpacks are added as items. Receiving one unlocks all 3 mods for that weapon.
    Individual Mods: Shock, Acid, and Lock-on mods are all added as separate items in the item pool.

    If this option is not set to Vanilla, any weapon can get any weapon mod.
